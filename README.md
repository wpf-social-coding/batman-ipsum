# Batman Ipsum CLI

Maybe you know [Batman Ipsum](http://batman-ipsum.com/) by [Bruno Simon](http://bruno-simon.com/). If don't know it you should check it out. It is Batman themed [filler text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filler_text) provider which uses quotes from [The Dark Knight Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_Trilogy).

For fun and education reasons I build a Ruby CLI app to access and print out those filler texts. Since the original web page is an Angular app there is a resource which provides all data in handy JSON format. Due to this I didn't need to build a scraper - Yay!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'batman_ipsum'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install batman_ipsum

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
